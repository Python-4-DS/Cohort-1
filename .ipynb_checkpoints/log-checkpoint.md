# Master Python for Data Science Handbook - Log

## Week 1: Introduction to Ipython

**Today's Progress**: Finished going through Introduction to Ipython

**Thoughts**: Feeling great to learn Ipython. No blockers so far.

## Week 2: Chapter 2: Introduction to Numpy

**This week's Progress**: Finished going through introduction to Numpy.

**Thoughts**: Numpy arrays are very interesting. Not only do they provide an efficient way of manipulating Datasets but also make it easier and faster.
              No blockers so far and having learnt the basis of dataset manipulation I'm more than eager to move to Pandas.

## Week 3: Chapter 3: Data Manipulation with Pandas

**This week's Progress**: Finished up on Data Manipulation with Pandas.

**Thoughts**: Wow! It feels great to finally understand Pandas. Its a pretty wide subject but equally productive.
               Very ready to dig into the challenge and gauge my understanding.

## Week 4: Practice(Challenge 1)

**This week's Progress**: Completed the Data Manipulation Challenge 1.

**Thoughts**: My first Data Science challenge. Very glad to have acquired some quality skills and very ready to dig into visualizations.

## Week 5: Chapter 4: Data Visualization

**This week's Progress**: Finished up on data Visualizations and did a self challenge. 

**Thoughts**: One of the most important chapters in Data Science. Glad to learn it.

## Week 6: Practice(Challenge 2)

**This week's Progress**: Finished on practice challenge 2: Blood Donation Prediction.

**Thoughts**: Glad to be able to tackle a typical machine Learning project.

## Week 7: Chapter 5: Machine Learning

**This week's Progress**: Finished going through Machine Learning basics with scikit-learn.

**Thoughts**: Its so great to finally understand the art of Machine Learning. I love the basics I've learnt and will continue learning to be able to build models which will solve problems facing the society.

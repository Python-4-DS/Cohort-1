## Week 2: Introduction to Numpy

**Week 2 Progress**: Finished going through Chapter 2 – Numpy Introduction

**Thoughts**: This has been my best chapter so far. There're a lot of thing I learnt on Numpy. I did document while writing code on my jupyter notebook to grasp skill in detail. I like the **fancy indexing**.

# Master Python for Data Science Handbook - Log

## Week 1: Introduction: IPython: Beyond Normal Python

**This Week's Progress**: Finished going through the basics of IPython.
In particular, I learned a lot of new commands on IPython. These include:
* Accessing Documentation with ``?``
* Accessing Source Code with ``??``
* Magic commands
* Profiling and timing code

**Thoughts**: I really struggled through ``Errors and Debugging``, but I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. The magic commands ``%paste`` and ``%cpaste`` didn't work.

## Week 2: Chapter 2: Introduction to Numpy

**This week's Progress**:
1. Understanding Data Types in Python

2. The Basics of Numpy Arrays

3. Computation on Numpy Arrays

4. Aggregations

5. Computations on Arrays

6. Comparisons, Masks, and Boolean Logic

7. Fancy Indexing

8. Sorting Arrays

9. Structured Data

**Thoughts**: I  have learned new NumPy operations. The computation and aggregation techniques, broadcasting techniques are very crucial. Fancy indexing was challenging.

## Week 3: Chapter 3: Data Manipulation with Pandas

**This week's Progress**:  
The focus on Pandas:
* [Introducing Pandas Objects](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_01_Introducing_Pandas_Objects.ipynb)
* [Data Indexing and Selection](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_02_Data_Indexing_and_Selection.ipynb)
* [Operating on Data in Pandas](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_03_Operations_in_Pandas.ipynb)
* [Handling Missing Data](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_04_Missing_Values.ipynb)
* [Hierarchical Indexing](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_05_Hierarchical_Indexing.ipynb)
* [Combining Datasets: Concat and Append](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_06_Concat_And_Append.ipynb)
* [Combining Datasets: Merge and Join](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_07_Merge_and_Join.ipynb)
* [Aggregation and Grouping](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_08_Aggregation_and_Grouping.ipynb)
* [Pivot Tables](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_09_Pivot_Tables.ipynb)
* [Vectorized String Operations](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_10_Working_With_Strings.ipynb)
* [Working with Time Series](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_11_Working_with_Time_Series.ipynb)
* [High-Performance Pandas: eval() and query()](https://github.com/twiga2/Python4ds_cohort-1/blob/dina/work/Chapter3_12_Performance_Eval_and_Query.ipynb)

**Thoughts**: Data Manipulation with Pandas builds on NumPy with a lot more techniques.

## Week 4: Practice(Challenge 1)

**This week's Progress**: Completed the analytics on Kiva data for loans across countries in terms of gender and sector.

**Thoughts**: All the concepts of Pandas are applied to the challenge.

# Master Python for Data Science Handbook - Log

## Week 1: Introduction
<!-- **(delete me or comment me out)** -->
### Chapter 1 - IPython: Beyond Normal Python
**Today's Progress**: Finished going through the basics of IPython.
In particular, I learned a lot of new commands on IPython, a powerful engine for Data Science. These include:
* Accessing Documentation with ``?``
* Accessing Source Code with ``??``
* Magic commands

**Thoughts**: I really struggled through ``Errors and Debugging``, but I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

# Master Python for Data Science Handbook - Log

## Week 1: Introduction: IPython: Beyond Normal Python

**This Week's Progress**: Finished going through the basics of IPython.
In particular, I learned a lot of new commands on IPython. These include:
* Accessing Documentation with ``?``
* Accessing Source Code with ``??``
* Magic commands
* Profiling and timing code

**Thoughts**: I really struggled through ``Errors and Debugging``, but I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. The magic commands ``%paste`` and ``%cpaste`` didn't work.

## Week 2: Chapter 2: Introduction to Numpy

**This week's Progress**:
1. Understanding Data Types in Python

2. The Basics of Numpy Arrays

3. Computation on Numpy Arrays

4. Aggregations

5. Computations on Arrays

6. Comparisons, Masks, and Boolean Logic

7. Fancy Indexing

8. Sorting Arrays

9. Structured Data

**Thoughts**: I  have learned new NumPy operations. The computation and aggregation techniques, broadcasting techniques are very crucial. Fancy indexing was challenging.

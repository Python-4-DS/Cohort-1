# Master Python for Data Science Handbook - Log

## Week 1: Introduction: IPython: Beyond Normal Python

**Today's Progress**: Installed Git for Windows. Set up GitHub account. Using Git Bash, I Forked and Cloned the "Python4ds_cohort-1" repository using Git Bash, and then created the branch "Meg". Installed Anaconda. Changed Jupyter working directory. Launched Ipython shell and notebook.

**Thoughts**: Learning and implementing Git commands using Git Bash has been a challenging, yet interesting experience. I'm looking forward to learning more.
